Location Name,location_name,NABat|Site Name,NABat|Site Name,"A user-defined name (6-character limit) of the specific location (or point) where a detector was deployed within a single grid cell. Being consistent with site names from year to year allows for easier sorting and interpretation of the data. For example, if four stationary detectors were deployed, each within a 5 km x 5 km quadrant in the same 10 km x 10 km grid cell, Site Names used to describe the four deployment locations could be 'NW', 'NE', 'SW,' and 'SE.' Alternatively, Site Names can be based on a nearby town name, habitat type, property name, and so forth. If a mobile acoustic transect survey was conducted within the same grid, an additional unique Site Name, for example, 'DT' (mobile driving transect), would be applied.",1,String,,
